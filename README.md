# Current Users
Sealog-Vehicle is currently in-use with the JASON ROV (WHOI), the Alvin HOV (WHOI), the Subastian ROV (SOI) and by the University of Rhode Islands Inner Space Center for shoreside event logging of the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer and E/V Nautilus.

# Thanks and acknowledgments
Sealog is in ongoing development thanks to the generosity of the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) who have supported the project since 2018. Thanks also to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) who provided the initial inspiration for the project and are it's first users.

Lastly I want to thank the UNOLS community who have helped me since the beginning by sharing their wealth of experience and technical ability.
